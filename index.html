<h1 id="how-dativ-works">How Dativ Works</h1>
<p>Dativ is 3rd case in german, and in the most simplest sense, it applies when something is being done with something else.</p>
<p>Whereas in Akkusativ, where something is being done to an object (<strong>Direct Object</strong>), Dativ applies when something is done with something else (<strong>Indirect Object</strong>).</p>
<p>This concept doesn&#39;t exist in English, so let&#39;s consider an example:</p>
<p><em>I am giving you a present</em></p>
<p>In this example, <em>the present</em> is the direct object, as it is what is being done too (it is being gifted). However, <em>you</em> is the <strong>indirect object</strong>, as the gift is given to you (but the verb does not directly affect you). Therefore, it is being done with you.</p>
<p>We can apply this same logic to another English example:</p>
<p><em>I am coming with you</em></p>
<p>In this sentence, <em>you</em> is the <strong>indirect</strong> object as nothing is being done directly to it, it is simply being done with (As you are coming - but with someone).</p>
<h1 id="articles">Articles</h1>
<p>Like every case, Dativ has its own set of articles:</p>
<p>In German, this means the majority of all prepositions invoke the Dativ case (as it implicates action with something).</p>

<p><strong>Note: when using Dativ with a plural noun, it must end in &quot;n&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>der Frosch üê∏ -&gt; dem Frosch</li>
<li>die Leherin -&gt; der Leherin</li>
<li>das Buch -&gt; dem Buch</li>
<li>die Kinder -&gt; den Kindern</li>

<h1 id="practical-knowledge">Practical Knowledge</h1>
<p>Because Dativ is invoked when something is done <strong>with</strong> something else, this means that many prepositions in german force the dativ case:</p>
<p><strong>mit, bei, aus, nach, zu, von, seit</strong> all force you to use dativ, meaning that any noun following these prepositions has to be dativ. This is important to remember because the majority of the time you are using dativ, you are probably going to be using these prepositions.</p>
<p>Therefore if you ever want to say your doing something <strong>with</strong> someone/something, then you automatically know it&#39;s dativ.</p>
<h2 id="contractions">Contractions</h2>
<p>German has several contractions that are specific to dativ. It is impossible to go through everyday life without noticing them:</p>
<ul>
<li>zu dem = zum</li>
<li>zu der = zur</li>
<li>bei dem = beim</li>
<li>von dem = vom</li>
<li>in dem = im</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also just a good basic thing to know.</p>
<h3 id="von-and-aus-">Von (and aus)</h3>
<p>Von is incredibly important to know, and I feel like many of you guys aren&#39;t sure of how to use it.</p>
<p>Aus means from, but only in a geographical context, so if you are (for example) from a country/state you can use it. </p>
<p>Von is what you use for any other situation where you want to say from. Additionally, because german doesn&#39;t have an exact word for &quot;of&quot;, we can use von- for example:</p>
<p><em>a friend of mine - ein Freund von mir</em></p>
<h1 id="with-verbs">With Verbs</h1>
<h2 id="dativ-only">Dativ Only</h2>
<p>Specific verbs are only dativ, or they require both dativ and akkusativ nouns.</p>
<p>For example, <em>glauben (to believe)</em> or <em>helfen (to help)</em> are dativ only verbs. For example:</p>
<p><em>Ich glaube dem Mann</em> or <em>Ich helfe dir</em></p>
<h2 id="dativ-akkusativ-verbs">Dativ + Akkusativ Verbs</h2>
<p>Many common verbs require a dativ and akkusativ noun.</p>
<p>For example, schulden (to owe) or schicken (to send), require a dativ <strong>indirect object</strong> and a akkusativ <strong>direct object</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><em>Ich schulde dir etwas</em></p>
<h1 id="bye-bye">Bye Bye</h1>
<p>I got too lazy to write more examples</p>
<p>that&#39;s it</p>
